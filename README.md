# SkyblockBossTimerMod
Minecraft Forge Mod to track the spawn times of the Hypixel Skyblock Magma Boss  


## Features
This acts as a client for the [Magma Boss Tracker website](https://hypixel.inventivetalent.org/skyblock-magma-timer/) and automatically tracks events, spawn & death of the boss.  
It also adds a simple time info UI.

NOTE: The UI is only visible if you're in the Blazing Fortress or the spawn is estimated to happen in less than 20 minutes.  
If you want to check it manually, just open the debug menu (F3) and you'll see it on the right.


## Options
You can change the mod's option, including the UI position in the Mod Options provided by Forge (Pause Menu -> Mod Options)
